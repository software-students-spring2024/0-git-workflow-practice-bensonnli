My Article: [Is AI in software engineering reaching an 'Oppenheimer moment'? Here's what you need to know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-ai-in-software-engineering-reaching-an-oppenheimer-moment-heres-what-you-need-to-know/).

The article covers software engineering and AI, explaining their roles, differences, applications, and ethical challenges. It defines software engineering as creating reliable software, contrasts it with traditional programming, and discusses AI's data-driven decision-making. AI's potential in suggesting optimizations and identifying bugs is noted, along with ethical considerations. The responsibility of software engineers in guiding AI's growth and ensuring ethical behavior is highlighted. It also reflects on AI's impact, urging continuous learning and ethical considerations on how much we should rely on it.

I find the overall comparison to of the anxiety yet intrigue of AI today with Oppenheimer and nuclear weaponry to be quite thought provoking. It is very interesting to read the varying discussions on ethics and AI. The idea that the ethical guidelines for AI systems currently fall on the engineers that are working with this AI does raise some concerns for me personally, as it is difficult to know how many people are working with some form of ethics in mind.
